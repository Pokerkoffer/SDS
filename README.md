# SDS
Software Distribution Service (C++)

##Summary
Act as a Secure Distribution Framework between a Client and Server, that will directly recieve and map encrypted modules directly into memory without the need to map anything on the harddrive. Masks any network connection and data sent and recieved using WinAPI. 


##Timeline
Will be uploaded soon once I finish running some tests on the internal build.
